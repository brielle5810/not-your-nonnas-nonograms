# not-your-nonnas-nonograms
 Nonograms are a type of logic puzzle where a grid is filled in according to numbers given to each row and column, revealing a pixel art image upon completion. Not Your Nonna's Nonograms is a nonogram playing platform using original pixel art based on my favorite anime, movies, video games, books, and more.
